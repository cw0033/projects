# Predicting Fatality of Gun Violence Incidents
## Project Overview
### Background
Gun violence has emerged as a critical and deeply troubling issue in the United States in recent years, marked by a disturbing rise in mass shootings, homicides, and suicides involving firearms. The prevalence of guns and the ease of access to them have been central to debates and discussions on public safety and gun control policies. Moreover, the impact of gun violence extends beyond the immediate loss of life, causing long-lasting trauma and grief to families and communities. Utilizing data from the gun violence dataset spanning the years 2013 to 2018, this project aims to delve into the underlying factors contributing to fatal gun violence incidents. Key objectives are to develop predictive model that can classify an incident as fatal or not and estimate the number of fatalities in each incident, thereby providing valuable insights that could inform policy decisions and intervention strategies.
